Version 0:
    Initial attempt to generate catalogues.
Version 1:
    Sucessfully (?) added in a data flag filter to remove noise due to radio 
    transmission.
Version 2:
    Added a cross correlation coefficient calculated 1 s around each flash 
    detection in the catalogues.
Version 4:
    Added a baseline_std column to the data to remove detections that appear
    to be noisy. Ran with the wavelet detector, but both seem to pick up the 
    noise. Version 5 will be the same, but with the burst parameter.
