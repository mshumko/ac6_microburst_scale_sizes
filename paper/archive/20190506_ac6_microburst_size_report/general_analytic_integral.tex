I looked for and found an elegant way to calculate the analytic microburst CDF that is generalized to any microburst PDF distributions. The microburst CDF observed by a two-point measurement is $F(s)$ where $s$ is the spacecraft separation. $F(s)$ can be interpreted as the fraction of microbursts that was observed above a separation $s$.
